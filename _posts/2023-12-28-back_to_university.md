After long reflection, I decided to leave MindEarth after one year and to go back to the University to start a PhD.

Despite being very happy with my job from both professional and personal point-of-view, I realized that my decision to interrupt my research career was
hurried and mainly dictated by post-thesis stress.

I felt to have a lot of energy to dedicate to a research activity and I realized that a PhD opportunity was quite unique.
My reseach group is lead by Professor Paolo Tonella and it is located in Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI), in Lugano.
My research will be related to Deep Learning and LLMs, with a specific focus on Adversarial/Poisoning attacks and the usage of LLMs for code generation.

I think that the year spent in MindEarth will be extremely useful for my PhD and for my career and, at the same time, I realized that there is nothing wrong to retrace your steps and to make a different choice, if you think that this is the best for you!
I hope that this experience will make the difference in my future!
