Formula USI at UniVerso 2025: Navigating Dynamic Tracks with AI!


---

This past weekend, I had the opportunity to showcase our autonomous racing project, Formula USI, at UniVerso 2025, the open day of USI Universit√† della Svizzera italiana. It was a great opportunity to present the latest advancements of AI-driven autonomous vehicles to a diverse group of visitors, ranging from curious children to tech enthusiasts.

A standout feature of our demonstration was the use of dynamically projected tracks. As flexible routes were projected onto the floor, our 1:16 scale autonomous vehicles followed dynamic paths in real time, showcasing their ability to adapt instantaneously to new challenges. Not only was this a hit with the crowd, but it also showed what AI can do in dynamic environments.

My heartfelt thank you to the Software Institute (USI) and Prof. Paolo Tonella for supporting my participation, and to Eng. Mauro Prevostini for the kind invitation. My deepest gratitude to my collaborators, Dr. Roberto Minelli and Gianmarco De Vita, whose dedication brought this demo to life.

Events like UniVerso bridge the divide between the public and the university, showing the real-world relevance of our work. I am grateful to be part of a community that values innovation and engagement.
