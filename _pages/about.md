I am Samuele Pasini and I am a `PhD researcher` in `USI Lugano`. I am a member of the [Software Institute](https://www.si.usi.ch) and I work under the supervision of [Prof. Paolo Tonella](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/tonella/#/). 

I am graduated at Politecnico di Milano, Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I specialized myself into `Artificial Intelligence` and `Deep Learnin`g, combining scientific research to a large amount of practical projects.
I have done my Thesis in the context of `Illegal Landfills Detection`, applying `Computer Vision` techniques in the field of `Remote Sensing` under the supervision of [Prof. Piero Fraternali](https://fraternali.faculty.polimi.it/?lang=it). 

After the graduation, I worked as `Computer Vision Engineer` for Mindearth, a Swiss company that operates in a wide range of sectors combining street-level and remote sensing imagery. <br>

After one year, I decided to start my PhD in USI. My research is related to `Deep Learning` and `LLMs`, with a specific focus on `Adversarial/Poisoning` attacks and the usage of `LLMs for code generation`.
