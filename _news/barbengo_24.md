Delighted to Share AI and Autonomous Driving Insights with Students! Grateful for the opportunity to inspire the next generation.

Last Friday, April 19th, I had the pleasure of participating in a workshop on artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles at the Barbengo Middle School. This event was organized by the Parent Assembly in collaboration with the Software Institute (SI) at the Faculty of Informatics.

Together with Roberto Minelli, the academic coordinator of the Software Institute, I introduced the students to the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and demonstrated how these ideas can be applied to the world of autonomous driving. We also engaged in a brief discussion with the twelve students present about the risks and ethical issues that AI brings to the realm of self-driving cars.

In the second part of the workshop, the students took center stage. They had the opportunity to drive a scaled-down car on a circuit using a joystick, gathering the data needed to train and test an AI model.
