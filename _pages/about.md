I am Samuele Pasini and I am a PhD researcher in USI Lugano. I am graduated at Politecnico di Milano, Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I specialized myself into AI and Deep Learning, combining scientific research to a large amount of practical projects. <br>
I have done my Thesis in the context of Illegal Landfills Detection, applying Computer Vision techniques in the field of Remote Sensing. <br>
After the graduation, I worked as Computer Vision Engineer for Mindearth, a Swiss company that operates in a wide range of sectors combining street-level and remote sensing imagery. <br>
After one year, I decided to start my PhD in USI Lugano. My research is related to Deep Learning and LLMs, with a specific focus on Adversarial/Poisoning attacks and the usage of LLMs for code generation.
