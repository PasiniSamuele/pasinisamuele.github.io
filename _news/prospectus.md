I successfully presented my Research Prospectus achieving a key PhD milestone! I am excited for the journey ahead.

---

I am delighted to share that I successfully discussed my Research Prospectus, marking a major milestone of my PhD journey at USI Università della Svizzera italiana.

My research is focused on proposing novel Deep Learning techniques to enhance the robustness of code generated by Large Language Models. This includes addressing challenges such as vulnerabilities in the generated code, hallucinations, and LLM poisoning.

A heartfelt thank you to my advisors, Prof. Paolo Tonella and Dr. Jinhan Kim, for their priceless support throughout this research. I am also grateful to the Prospectus Committee for their feedback.

While this milestone is a cause for celebration, it is just the beginning. There’s still much to achieve and I am excited to dive deeper into the research ahead.
