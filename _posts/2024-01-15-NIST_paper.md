Few days ago, I found an extremely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/adversarial-machine-learning-taxonomy-and-terminology-attacks-and-mitigations">interesting work </a> published by NIST, regarding Adversarial Machine Learning <d-cite key="vassilev2024adversarial"></d-cite>.
The authors explore several concepts and they define a taxonomy that I have found extremely useful to approach the research in the field of Adversarial Machine Learning.

After exploring the most relevant attacks and mitigations, the authors propose open challenges.
This work will be likely relevant in my future research, and I suggest to read it to anyone interested in the subject.
