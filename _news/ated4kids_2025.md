:dart: Another Chapter for Formula USI :dart:

---

I am thrilled to share that I managed to participate in the ated4Kids Summer Camp this week, arranged in Melide by Ated-Associazione Ticinese Evoluzione Digitale. It's my second collaboration with Ated, and it's always a pleasure to work with their dedicated team.

I’m continually amazed by the enthusiasm and curiosity that topics like AI and Autonomous Driving spark in kids and young people. Introducing these themes at an early age not only fuels their curiosity but also helps them build a genuine interest and knowledge in technologies that will shape their future.

A warm thank you to Software Institute (USI), Prof. Paolo Tonella, and USI Università della Svizzera italiana for enabling me to be part of this experience. Special thanks to Ated-Associazione Ticinese Evoluzione Digitale for the invitation, and to my colleague and friend Dr. Roberto Minelli, who joined me in this journey.

Here’s to the next milestone for Formula USI… Stay tuned, because we have something big coming up!
