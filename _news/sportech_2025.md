Amazing Experience at Sportech 2025!

---

Last week, I participated in Sportech2025, an event dedicated to the intersection of Sports and Technology. 

Along with my team from USI Università della Svizzera italiana, we proposed a workshop on Autonomous Driving cars for Races and the application of Artificial Intelligence in this domain. The event was successful, with students demonstrating enthusiasm and engagement throughout the workshop! 

A heartfelt thank you to National Youth Sports Centre Tenero CST and Scuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana (SUPSI) for the organization of this event and to Mauro Prevostini for the invitation to this initiative.

Special thanks to my colleagues Matteo Biagiola, Gianmarco De Vita and Roberto Minelli, we were a winning team and I couldn't be prouder of our work! 

Events like Sportech 2025 remind me why I’m passionate about this field: the energy, the ideas, and the impact!
