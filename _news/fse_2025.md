:bulb: Inspiring Moments at FSE & ISSTA 2025

---
Last week in Trondheim, Norway, I was honored to be part of FSE & ISSTA 2025, two top conferences on software engineering research. I was especially energized by the talks on LLM testing, deep learning-based test generation, and agentic LLM engineering—areas where AI and SE research blend with practical applications.

One of the highlight sessions was the paper "Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations." It is a paper that proposes employing metamorphic relations and mutations to verify factual coherence of LLM outputs. It is a strong and elegant solution to one of the major LLM problem, and it inspired me with new ideas for my own research on reliable LLM systems.

Beyond the sessions, I also appreciated the chance to explore Trondheim—an amazing Norwegian city with a vibrant culture and walkable charm.

A heartfelt thanks to Prof. Paolo Tonella, the Software Institute (USI), and USI Università della Svizzera italiana for making this possible.

I'm already eager to look forward to the next chance to share ideas, innovations, and further the conversations initiated here.
